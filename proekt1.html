                <p id="tekst">A computer’s motherboard is typically the largest printed circuit board in a machine’s chassis. It distributes electricity and facilitates communication between 
                    and<br> to the central processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), and any other component of the computer’s hardware.
                     There is a broad range of <br>motherboards, each of which is intended to be compatible with a specific model and size of the computer.

                    Since different kinds of processors and memories are intended to function best with certain types of motherboards, it is difficult to find a motherboard that is compatible with every type of CPU and memory.
                    <br> Hard drives, on the other hand, are generally compatible with a wide variety of motherboards and may be used with most brands and types.
                    A computer motherboard may be found inside a computer casing,<br> which is the point of connection for most of the computer’s elements and peripherals.
                     When it comes<br> to tower computers,  one may look for a motherboard on either the right or left side of the tower; the circuit board is the most significant.

                <h1 style="font-size: 3em;">What is a processor(CPU)?</h1>
                <p>A processor is an integrated electronic circuit that performs the calculations that run a computer.<br> A processor performs arithmetical, logical, input/output (I/O) and other basic instructions that are <br>passed from an operating system (OS). Most other processes are dependent on the operations of a processor.

                    The terms processor, central processing unit (CPU) and microprocessor are commonly<br> linked as synonyms. Most people use the word “processor” interchangeably with the term “CPU” nowadays, it is technically not correct since the CPU is just one of the processors inside a personal computer (PC).
                    
                    The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is another processor, and even some hard<br> drives are technically capable of performing some processing
                    Every time that an operation is <br>performed on a computer, such as when a file is changed or an application is open, the processor<br> must interpret the operating system or software’s instructions.

                <h1 style="font-size: 3em;">What is a graphics card?</h1>
                <p>A graphics card (also called a video card, display card, graphics adapter, VGA card/VGA, video adapter, display adapter, or colloquially GPU) is a computer expansion card that generates a feed of graphics<br> output to a display device such as a monitor. Graphics cards are sometimes called discrete or dedicated graphics cards to emphasize their distinction to integrated graphics processor on the motherboard or the CPU. A graphics processing unit (GPU) that performs the necessary computations is the main component<br> in a graphics card, but the acronym "GPU" is sometimes also used to erroneously refer to the graphics <br>card as a whole.

                    Most graphics cards are not limited to simple display output. The graphics processing unit can be used for additional processing, which reduces the load from the central processing unit.<br> Additionally, computing platforms such as OpenCL and CUDA allow using graphics cards for<br> general-purpose computing. Applications of general-purpose computing on graphics cards include AI<br> training, cryptocurrency mining, and molecular simulation.</p>

                <h1 style="font-size: 3em;">What is a hard disk drive?</h1>
                <p>A hard disk drive (HDD) is an internal or external computer component that stores data, such as the <br>operating system, applications, and user files.

                    HDDs are “non-volatile” storage devices, meaning they <br>retain stored data even when power isn't being supplied.
                    An HDD includes two main elements;<br> a spinning platter and an actuator arm.<br>

                    The platter is a circular magnetic disk containing tracks and sectors that retain data.<br>
                    The actuator arm moves across the platter to read and write data.<br>
                    The platter spins (hence the name) on a spindle to help speed up the read/write process as the<br> actuator arm moves across it.
                    
                    The data sectors are spread out randomly (also known as fragmented) across the platter, and below we'll discuss defragmenting a hard drive to boost performance.<br>
                    The platter and the actuator arm are delicate physical mechanisms, so a solid case covers them to prevent damage under normal use. The hard drive cover will look like a metal box, and it will be clearly labeled as a hard disk drive or HDD.

                <h1 style="font-size: 3em;">What is RAM?</h1>
                <p>Random-access memory (RAM) is a form of electronic computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of <br>data inside the memory, in contrast with other direct-access data storage media (such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory), where the time required to read and <br>write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.RAM contains multiplexing and demultiplexing circuitry, to connect the data lines to the addressed storage for reading or writing the entry. Usually more than one bit of storage is accessed by the same address, and RAM devices often have<br> multiple data lines and are said to be "8-bit" or "16-bit", etc. devices.In today's technology, random-access memory takes the form of integrated circuit (IC) chips with MOS (metal–oxide–semiconductor) memory<br> cells.RAM is normally associated with volatile types of memory where stored information is lost if power is removed.
